## Installation 
For GTA5 **Legacy** and **Enhanced**:

* Install the latest version of [ScriptHookV .Net Enhanced](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/script-hook-v-net-enhanced) 
 
``` (SHVDN nightly builds wouldn't work, as the advanced features are offered by SHVDNE. Your other scripts, which depend on SHVDN, will still work with SHVDNE, even on Legacy) ```
* Install the latest version of [LemonUI](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/lemonui) for SHVDN3.
* Download ``Advanced Trainer`` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Chiheb-Bacha/Advanced-Trainer-V/releases), unzip it and drop ``Advanced Trainer.dll`` into your scripts folder.
